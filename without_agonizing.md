# Without the pain

With thanks to John Rauser: [Statistics Without the Agonizing Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dnw46eC-0o)

# Problem 1 - a biased jury?

* Around 1962: Robert Swain - a black man - sentenced to death
  by an all-white Jury in Talladega County, Alabama.
* Of the eligible jurors in the county, 26% were black.
* Swain appealed eventually to the [Supreme
  Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swain_v._Alabama) on the
  basis that the jury selection was biased.
* What do you think?

# Problem 2 - do mosquitoes like beer?
